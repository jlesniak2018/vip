### Evaluating MOOCDB for Coursera Data - [Main Docs](http://moocdbdocs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

#### Evaluation Notes
* The Piping scripts provided combines the data - [Anonymized Forum, Anonymized General, Hash Mapping] provided by coursera for a particula course into a Target database of our choosing.
* The Scripts successfully map the users and session id across the hash_mapp - No Loss of Users

#### TODO
- [ ] Why do we need **moocdb_core** and **moocdb_clean** databases?
- [ ] After checking the logs generated by the piping scripts, observe the following failed cases :
  - [ ] Eg : Failed to parse quiz XML for quiz 40. Skippping this quiz and its submissions
  - [ ] Eg : A question id found in a student response does not exist in the quiz XML! Question ID in student response: 49ec22c8a5bcc3e5be33545a76d30b2a, Question IDs from XML
  - [ ] Eg : Unexpected answer format for question prime_question
  - [ ] Eg : Failed to load php-serialized string:... Skipping this record

#### Database Schema Visualized 
- Moocdb Core and Schema (Moocdb Clean) : is used by all transformation tasks; Import once and use many times[i, ii]. 
- Target (Moocdb Output) : Data after transformations are put into this database for future analysis [iii].
